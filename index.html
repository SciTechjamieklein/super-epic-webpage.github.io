<p>here's a cat! his name is maxwell and he likes to dance.<br>...<br>if you're here you're probably aware of that fact already (it's a big meme).<br>if you hover over maxwell with your mouse or gently touch him with your finger or really just interact with him in any way he'll become more pink.<br><br><br>the thing about this webpage is...<br>i barely even know how to make a webpage!<br>this is just me making some goofy fun stuff and trying to learn from it.<br>:)<br><br></p>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('thing').innerHTML = yoy()">CLICK TO OBTAIN YIPPEE</button>
<h3>i love buttons!</h3>
<p>this is the end of the webpage as we know it (and i feel fine). i will add more stuff later.</p>
