<p>here's a cat! his name is maxwell and he likes to dance.<br>...<br>if you're here you're probably aware of that fact already (it's a big meme).<br>if you hover over maxwell with your mouse or gently touch him with your finger or really just interact with him in any way he'll become more pink.<br><br><br>a cool thing about this webpage is...<br>i barely even know how to make a webpage!<br>this is just me making some goofy fun stuff and trying to learn from it.<br>:)<br><br>this is an experiment that i made because i was bored<br><br>ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ<br>cat<br><br></p>

<p>this is the end of the webpage as we know it (and i feel fine). i will add more stuff later. also if this is a bit broken, it's because i am adding a save function dependent on wild magic and i only had the motivation to impliment it for yippee amounts.</p>
